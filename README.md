JS mulitplayer survival shootem-up


concepts
========

ideas from balcony sesh:
 - survival type? or survival/deathmatch?
 - friendly fire
 - griefers become enemies
 - bounties (randomly?) put out on players

technical issues
================

where should collision detection occur?
 - both front and backend, but backend decides whether it was a true hit or miss
 - need to do collision detection on front end for animations
 - need to to do collision detection on back end for truth


the more logic put onto the backend, the more code we can use on the client for animations, efx, SOUNDS!!!, etc.
